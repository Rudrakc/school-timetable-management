# School Timetable Builder: Implementation Guide

This step-by-step guide will help you build a robust School Timetable Builder web application with React and TypeScript. Follow these instructions to create a solution that not only meets the basic requirements but also implements all optional features to exceed expectations.

## Project Overview

You'll be developing a web application that allows school administrators to generate and edit weekly timetables for classes while respecting various constraints like teacher availability and subject distribution.

## Environment Setup

- [x] Create a new React TypeScript project
- [x] Install necessary dependencies:
  - Zustand for state management
  - Framer Motion for animations
  - React Beautiful DnD for drag and drop
  - Styled Components for styling
  - TypeScript types for all libraries

## Part 1: Project Structure & Type Definitions

- [x] Set up a clean, scalable project structure:

  - Components folder with component-specific subdirectories
  - Hooks for custom React hooks
  - Store for Zustand state management
  - Types for TypeScript interfaces and types
  - Utils for helper functions
  - Constants for app-wide constants

- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces for core data models:
  - Subject interface (id, name, weeklyLectures)
  - Teacher interface (id, name, availableSlots)
  - TimeSlot interface (day, period)
  - TimetableEntry interface (id, subjectId, teacherId, day, period)
  - ValidationError interface (id, message, severity)

## Part 2: State Management with Zustand

- [x] Create a central store using Zustand to manage application state:
  - Store the subjects, teachers, days, and periods
  - Maintain the current timetable entries
  - Track validation errors
  - Implement actions for initializing and modifying the timetable
  - Add validation logic for timetable modifications

## Part 3: Core Algorithm Implementation

- [x] Implement the timetable generation algorithm:

  - Create a map of available slots for each teacher
  - Create a distribution plan for subjects
  - Assign teachers to subjects while respecting constraints
  - Ensure even distribution of subjects across the week

- [x] Implement validation logic:
  - Check if all subjects have the correct number of lectures
  - Validate teacher availability for each assigned slot
  - Ensure no teacher is double-booked
  - Validate that all constraints are met after any changes

## Part 4: UI Components

- [ ] Create the main timetable grid component:

  - Set up drag and drop context
  - Create the grid structure with days and periods
  - Implement cells that can contain timetable entries
  - Handle drag and drop events with validation

- [ ] Create draggable subject card components:

  - Display subject name and assigned teacher
  - Make cards draggable
  - Add visual feedback for drag operations
  - Implement animations for transitions

- [ ] Create validation message components:
  - Display active validation errors
  - Categorize errors by severity
  - Animate error appearance and disappearance
  - Provide clear, actionable error messages

## Part 5: Animations and UX Enhancements

- [ ] Implement smooth animations with Framer Motion:

  - Define animation variants for different states
  - Add transitions between states
  - Create hover and active state animations
  - Ensure animations enhance rather than hinder usability

- [ ] Create visual feedback for drag and drop operations:
  - Highlight valid drop targets
  - Show visual cues for invalid operations
  - Provide smooth transitions during drag operations
  - Give immediate feedback on validation status

## Part 6: Advanced Features Implementation

- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop with validation:

  - Validate moves before they are committed
  - Check all constraints during drag operations
  - Prevent invalid moves
  - Provide feedback on why a move is invalid

- [ ] Add real-time validation feedback:

  - Show preview of validation during drag hover
  - Display specific error messages for invalid operations
  - Update validation status as the user interacts
  - Ensure feedback is clear and non-intrusive

- [ ] Create summary statistics dashboard:
  - Show subject distribution statistics
  - Display teacher workload information
  - Visualize timetable completeness
  - Update dynamically as changes are made

## Part 7: Documentation & Code Quality

- [ ] Add comprehensive TypeDoc comments to all functions and components
- [ ] Set up ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting
- [ ] Create well-organized component folder structure:
  - Each component in its own directory
  - Include index.ts for clean imports
  - Separate style files
  - Include component-specific tests

## Part 8: Final Integration & Polishing

- [ ] Create a polished main application component:

  - Integrate all components
  - Add global styling with ThemeProvider
  - Implement responsive layout
  - Add animations for initial page load

- [ ] Add responsive layout with styled-components:
  - Define theme with color palette
  - Create breakpoints for different screen sizes
  - Ensure accessibility standards are met
  - Optimize for mobile and desktop viewing

## Final Checklist for Submission

- [ ] All components are built with TypeScript, using proper types and interfaces
- [ ] Code structure follows best practices with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] All features are implemented, including bonus features:
  - [ ] Drag-and-drop editing with validation
  - [ ] Real-time error messages
  - [ ] Smooth UI/UX with animations using Framer Motion
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Code is properly documented
- [ ] Application is responsive and works on different screen sizes
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or warnings
- [ ] ESLint and Prettier configurations are applied

## Best Practices Emphasized Throughout

1. **Strict TypeScript Usage**

   - Use proper interfaces for all data structures
   - Avoid using `any` type
   - Utilize generics when appropriate
   - Define return types for all functions

2. **Component Structure**

   - Follow the Single Responsibility Principle
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use custom hooks to extract complex logic

3. **State Management**

   - Keep related state together
   - Use immutable update patterns
   - Minimize prop drilling with context or global store

4. **Code Quality**

   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Meaningful variable and function names
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
   - Comments for complex logic

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memoize expensive calculations
   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Optimize re-renders with careful state management
